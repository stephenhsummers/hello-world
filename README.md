Hello World repo created as first repo
##############################

This is my first real go at using git properly.

I'm Steve and I am training to become a test engineer. My first work project will be writing tests for a web application using Ruby.
My interest at home is to enhance an application developed using Python and Django.
So it looks like I have an interesting time ahead of me.
